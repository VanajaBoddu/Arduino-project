# Arduino-project
The LM35 temperature sensor, connected to an Arduino Uno in Tinkercad, shows a fundamental application of sensor technology and microcontroller programming. By monitoring ambient temperature, the project demonstrates how an analog sensor may communicate with digital platforms such as Arduino to take precise actions in response to environmental variables.

This project teaches users fundamental concepts like as analog-to-digital conversion, conditional programming, and real-time data processing. Furthermore, the combination of Tinkercad with Arduino creates a virtual environment for designing and testing electronic systems, promoting hands-on learning and experimentation in the absence of physical components. Overall, this project provides a foundation for understanding sensor interfacing, data collecting, and fundamental control systems, setting the way for more complex IoT and automation initiatives.

The code for this project allows you to integrate an LM35 temperature sensor with an Arduino Uno board in Tinkercad. The code allows for real-time temperature monitoring and control of the onboard LED depending on set temperature thresholds. The code ensures responsive LED blinking patterns at varied intervals by using efficient programming techniques that do not reliant on delay() or millis(), thereby improving user knowledge of sensor data processing and conditional programming. This succinct yet sturdy code exemplifies the combination of hardware and software in embedded systems, making it an excellent learning tool for budding electronics enthusiasts and students working on Arduino-based projects.
